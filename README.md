## Usage Information
Similarly to how Seren spirits work, the game polls once per minute at the start of the minute to check if the player has a [Scripture of Bik](https://runescape.wiki/w/Scripture_of_Bik) equipped and turned on _and_ earns experience in a relevant skill. If the player meets these conditions, the game rolls for a random chance to spawn a [Catalyst of alteration](https://runescape.wiki/w/Catalyst_of_alteration). The game does not check any other point of time for Catalyst roll eligibility, thus keeping the Scripture of Bik turned on for the entire minute is not necessary - by cheesing the mechanics and only activating the book while it's possible to successfully roll a Catalyst spawn, you can save significant amounts of money while farming clue scrolls.

In order for the timer to be most accurate, you should enable chat timestamps in your settings and use those timestamps to synchronize the timer to the game clock; the number shown on the timer should match the seconds place of the chat timestamps (this can be verified by regularly examining things, turning on all game messages, or being in a location where many players are chatting). The visual game clock that is present in the UI may sometimes become desynchronized with the world clock, meaning that synchronizing the timer with the UI game clock will be inaccurate and yield no Catalyst spawns. This is particularly problemic while training on very high population worlds, such as at w70 Artisans Workshop, or w79 Incandescent Wisps.

In the same vein that the UI clock can become desynchronized from the actual game clock, actions can also become severely delayed on high population worlds (both client and server side). Because of this, I suggest that if you are on a high population world, you enable the book at approximately XX:XX:55, and disable it at XX:XX:05. Though this does consume more charges from the book, consumed charges are more favorable than missed proc opportunities.

## Fork Purpose
I don't like Google analytics in any way, shape, or form. This fork provides all the functionality of the original repo, but without the analytics.

In the future, I may choose to add functionality, such as automatic synchronization via chat timestamps, sounds, and customizable alert timings.
